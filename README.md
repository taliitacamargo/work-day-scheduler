# Project Description

When using a daily planner to create a schedule
When I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
When I scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
When I view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
When I click into a timeblock, I can enter an event
When I click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage
When I refresh the page, the saved events persist
